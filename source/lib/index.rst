Library Management
==================

*PlatformIO Library Manager* is a tool for managing libraries of
`PlatformIO Registry <https://platformio.org/lib>`__ and VCS repositories (Git,
Hg, SVN). It makes it exceedingly simple to find, install and keep libraries
up-to-date. PlatformIO Library Manager supports
`Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org>`_ and its rules.
